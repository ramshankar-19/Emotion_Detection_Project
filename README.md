## Overview

The Emotion Detection Project aims to classify text samples into different emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict emotions from user input.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- Visualization of results

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramshankar-19/Emotion_Detection_Project.git
   cd Emotion_Detection_Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If `requirements.txt` is not present, install common packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, jupyter)

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Emotion_Detection_Project.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Dataset

- The project uses a labeled emotion dataset (add dataset details here).
- [Optional] Download link or data source.

## Model

- Explains the machine learning models used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).
- Feature extraction methods (e.g., TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words).

## Results

- [Add performance metrics, confusion matrix, sample predictions, etc.]
- Visualizations and interpretations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for improvements.
