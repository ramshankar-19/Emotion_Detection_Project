## Overview

The Emotion Detection Project aims to classify text samples into different emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict emotions from user input.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- Visualization of results

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramshankar-19/Emotion_Detection_Project.git
   cd Emotion_Detection_Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If `requirements.txt` is not present, install common packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, jupyter)

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Emotion_Detection_Project.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset

- The project uses a labeled emotion dataset .


## Model

- Explains the machine learning models used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).
- Feature extraction methods (e.g., TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words).
